- A devoted member of [DISCOVER Robotics](https://airbots.online)
- A skeptic of thoughtless scaling laws
- A pursuer of technical excellence and efficiency
- An enthusiast of landscape photography. See my photo collection [here]()!

I am currently working with [Prof. Guyue Zhou](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1199.htm), devoted to bringing robots into **millions of households**!
