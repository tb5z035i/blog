Welcome to my blog! This is the first post, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme.

## Getting Started

You can create new posts by running:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

Then edit the generated file under `content/posts/` and set `draft = false` when you're ready to publish.

## Comments

This blog uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments, backed by GitHub Discussions. Feel free to leave a comment below!
